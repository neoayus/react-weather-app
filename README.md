# React Weather App

[Live Demo on Netlify](https://neoayus-react-weather-app.netlify.app/)

## Introduction

The React Weather App is an innovative and fully functional front-end project designed to display real-time weather information in a visually appealing and responsive interface. This application serves as a practical demonstration of front-end development skills, particularly in building interactive UIs and integrating external APIs.

Developed using **React.js** and styled with the **Material UI** component library, the app ensures a clean, modern user experience. It fetches live weather data using a **Weather API**, presenting details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions. The implementation of responsive design principles ensures that the application performs seamlessly across various devices, from desktops to smartphones.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of the React Weather App is to provide users with a clean, responsive, and interactive platform to access real-time weather information. This project emphasizes:
